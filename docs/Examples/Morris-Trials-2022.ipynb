    "The following is a replication of the analyses described in Morris et al. (2022)., which uses data from Wilson E et al. (2017). Morris et al. examine three different approaches to adjust for prognostic factors in randomized trials. The three ways are direct adjustment, standardization, and inverse probability weighting. This example highlights how causal inference methods (like those in the Hernan & Robins (2023)) can be used in randomized trials.\n",

    "\n",
    "For standardization (or g-computation), we stack several estimating equations together. Let $Y$ indicate the outcome, $A$ indicate the treatment, and $W$ are the prognostic factors included in the model (age, gender, sexual orientation, number of partners, ethnicity). The parameters are $\\theta$, which we further divide into the interest parameters ($\\mu_0, \\mu_1, \\mu_2, \\mu_3$) and the nuisance parameters ($\\beta$). As their name implies, nuisance parameters are not of interest but are necessary for estimation for our interest parameters. Importantly, by stacking the estimating equations, we can account for the uncertainty in the estimation of the nuisance parameters into the uncertainty in our interest parameters automatically.\n",
    "\n",
    "The estimating equations are\n",
    "$$\\psi(Y_i, A_i, W_i; \\theta) =\n",
    "\\begin{bmatrix} \n",
    "    (\\mu_1 - \\mu_0) - \\mu_2 \\\\ \n",
    "    \\log(\\mu_1 / \\mu_0) - \\mu_3 \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{Y}_i^{a=1} - \\mu_1 \\\\\n",
    "    \\hat{Y}_i^{a=0} - \\mu_0 \\\\\n",
    "    (Y_i - \\text{expit}(g(A_i,W_i)^T \\beta)) g(A_i,W_i)_i\n",
    "\\end{bmatrix}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "\n",
    "where $g(A_i,W_i)$ is a specific function to generate the design matrix, and $\\hat{Y}_i^{a} = \\text{expit}(g(a,W_i)^T \\beta)$. The first equation in the stack is the risk difference (RD) and the second is the log-transformed risk ratio (RR). Notice that these are defined in terms of other parameters. Specifically, parameters from the third and fourth equations, which correspond to the risk under all-1 and the risk under all-0. The predicted values of the outcome are generated using the parameters from the final equation, which is the logistic model used to estimate the probability of $Y_i$ conditional on $A_i,W_i$.\n",
    "\n",
    "An astute reader may notice that we could actually shorten this stack of equations. Rather than estimate $\\mu_2,\\mu_3$, we could have plugged the corresponding $\\hat{Y}_i^{a}$ into the first and second equations (thereby removing the need for the third and fourth). While this is correct, we prefer the process above for three reasons:\n",
    "1. The above stacked equations give us the correspond risk under each arm, which also may be of interest (what was the risk under a=0). Therefore, no extra steps are necessary to get this estimated parameter.\n",
    "2. This second argument is more technical. Here, we use a root-finding procedure to get $\\hat{\\theta}$. During this process we plug in different values for $\\hat{\\theta}$ until we find the (approximate) zeroes. For the RR, some values during the exploration of values may result in $\\hat{Y}_i^{a=0} = 0$. This causes a division by zero and may break the root-finding procedure. By instead calculating the average of $\\hat{Y}_i^{a=0}$ across all $i$'s, we reduce the opporuntity for a rogue zero.\n",
    "3. Related to the previous reason, the optimization procedure will run much faster since we only need to take the log of a single number as opposed to as an array. While this won't make much of a difference in run-time here, it is good practice (and may be important in problems with more complex estimating equations).\n",
    "\n",
    "Below we write out the estimating equation by-hand (except for the regression component, which we use a built-in functionality), estimate with our M-estimator, and then provide the results (similar to Table 3)."

    "### Differences in Results\n",
    "As promised, let's return to the differences in the answers. Why does this occur? The most likely culprit is the differences in the procedures for finding $\\hat{\\theta}$ across software.\n",
    "\n",
    "`delicatessen` operates by a root-finding procedure. Essentially, we are looking for the values of $\\hat{\\theta}$ that lead to the estimating equations all being approximately zero. Specifically, I am using the Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm in these examples. `delicatessen` uses a root-finding procedure because it simplifies building stacked estimating equations. However, this comes at the cost of speed and robustness of other approaches.\n",
    "\n",
    "Other regression software tends to proceed under a different approach. Generally, most software aims to maximize the log-likelihood. As before, there are a variety of algorithms that can be used to find the maximize the likelihood. However, most algorithms take advantage of both the log-likelihood and the score function (the derivative of the log-likelihood) to find the maximum. This means they are quite robust to sparse data while also being fast. As there is sparse data (there are many categorical variables for number of partners), this is the most likely explanation for the small differences.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Conclusion \n",
    "\n",
    "We replicated selected analyses in Morris et al. (2022) to showcase the basics of stacking estimating equations and how they are implemented in `delicatessen`. While `delicatessen` has built-in functionalities for standardization and inverse probability weighting, we opted to present them by-hand here. By-hand takes some extra work but it provides a better idea of how `delicatessen` can be used to build estimating equations. For example, each of the above approaches could further be extended to account for missing outcomes under a weaker assumption.\n",
