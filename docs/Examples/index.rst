Applied Examples
==========================

This section provides illustrative applications of the estimators provided in ``delicatessen``. These examples include
replication of examples from textbooks, published scientific articles, and custom examples. Both built-in estimating
equations and use of user-built estimating equations are illustrated. These examples are somewhat organized by the
topics being covered. Example applications include biomedical research, econometrics, sociology, cheminformatics,
and astrostatistics. If there are applications you would like to see added to this documentations, please contact us.
