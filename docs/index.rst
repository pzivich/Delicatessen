Delicatessen
=====================================

``delicatessen`` is a one-stop shop for all your sandwich (variance) needs. This Python 3.8+ library supports
estimation of parameters expressed via estimating equations, which is a general statistical framework for estimating
unknown parameters. This framework is also commonly known as M-estimation and Generalized Method of Moments.

Here, we provide a brief overview of estimating equations. For a more detailed, please refer to Ross et al. (2024),
Stefanski & Boos (2002), or Boos & Stefanski (2013). Estimating equations were developed to study the large sample
properties of robust statistics. However, many common large-sample statistics can be expressed with estimating
equations, so this framework provides a unified structure and a streamlined approach to estimation. Let the parameter
of interest be the vector :math:`\theta = (\theta_1, \theta_2, ..., \theta_v)` and data is observed for :math:`n`
independent units :math:`O_1, O_2, â€¦, O_n`. An M-estimator, :math:`\hat{\theta}`, is the solution to the estimating
equation :math:`\sum_{i=1}^{n} \psi(O_i, \hat{\theta}) = 0` where :math:`\psi` is a known :math:`v \times 1`-dimension
estimating function. This construction provides a convenient and automatic method of calculating large-sample variance
estimators via the empirical sandwich variance estimator:

.. math::

    V_n(O,\hat{\theta}) = B_n(O,\hat{\theta})^{-1} M_n(O,\hat{\theta}) \left(B_n(O,\hat{\theta})^{-1}\right)^T

where the 'bread' is

.. math::

    B_n(O,\hat{\theta}) = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n - \psi'(O_i, \hat{\theta})

where the :math:`\psi'` indicates the partial derivative, and the 'meat' or 'filling' is

.. math::

    M_n(O, \hat{\theta}) = n^{-1} \sum_{i=1}^n \psi(O_i, \hat{\theta}) \psi(O_i, \hat{\theta})^T

While estimating equations are general, their application can be hindered by the corresponding derivative and matrix
calculations. To circumvent these barriers, ``delicatessen`` automates the estimation procedure.

The following description is a high-level overview. The user specifies as :math:`v \times n` array of estimating
function(s). This array is provided to either the ``MEstimator`` class object or ``GMMEstimator`` class object. The
different between these objects is how the underlying parameters are estimated (``MEstimator`` uses root-finding
algorithms, while ``GMMEstimator`` uses minimization algorithms). Regardless, either esitmator object solves for
:math:`\hat{\theta}`. After successful completion of the root-finding, the bread is computing the partial derivatives
and the meat is calculated via the outer product. Finally, the empirical sandwich variance is computed.

If you are an R user, I recommend looking into ``geex``
(`Saul & Hudgens (2020) <https://bsaul.github.io/geex/>`_). ``delicatessen`` supports a variety of pre-built estimating
equations as well as custom, user built estimating equations.

Installation:
-------------

To install ``delicatessen``, use the following command in terminal or command prompt

``python -m pip install delicatessen``

Only two dependencies for ``delicatessen`` are: ``NumPy``, ``SciPy``.

While ``pandas`` is not a dependency, several examples are demonstrated with pandas for ease of data processing. To
replicate the tests in ``tests/`` you will need to also install ``pandas``, ``statsmodels`` and ``pytest`` (but these
are not necessary for use of the package).
